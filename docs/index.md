# Introduction

The Snikket Service is the core part of running your own messaging service. It provides
everything required for the Snikket app on users' devices to connect and exchange messages,
media and calls.

If you are looking to set up Snikket for the first time, start with the [quick start guide](setup/quickstart.md).

After setup, if you want to explore further, check out the advanced topics.

# Feedback

We're always looking to improve Snikket further. Feel free to reach out at <feedback@snikket.org>.
Let us know if you encountered any difficulty setting up, or even if it was a breeze!
